The project originated at Harvard Divinity School, where both founders studied and shared an interest in 
religion without God - with Vanessa Zoltan describing herself as "an atheist and a Jew and a humanist"[3] and Casper Ter Kuile training as a minister for non-religious people.[4] 
The inspiration for the podcast was a lecture by Zoltan on reading Jane Eyre as a sacred text, which Ter Kuile attended. 
As a fan of the Harry Potter books, he persuaded Zoltan to attempt to apply the same method of sacred reading to Harry Potter.[5]
